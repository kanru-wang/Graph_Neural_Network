## Chapter 5. Label Propagation for Node Classification

- Relational classification: Propagate node labels across the network. Iteratively update probabilities of node belonging to a label class based on its neighbors.
- Iterative Classification: Tabulate the incoming / outcoming predicted label information. Then train a classifier to classify each node based on its features as well as labels of neighbors; do that iteratively.
- Correct & Smooth

## Chapter 6. Graph Neural Networks 1: GNN Model

Can solve:
- Node classification - Predict a type of a given node
- Link prediction - Predict whether two nodes are linked
- Community detection - Identify densely linked clusters of nodes
- Network similarity - How similar are two (sub)networks

Average neighborâ€™s previous layer embeddings and matrix multiply the weights. So as long as the embedding length is fixed, the model can handle any number of neighbors.

-	CNN can be seen as a special GNN with fixed neighbor size and ordering.
-	The size of the filter is pre-defined for a CNN.
-	The advantage of GNN is it processes arbitrary graphs with different degrees for each node.
-	CNN is not permutation equivariant. Switching the order of pixels will lead to different outputs.
